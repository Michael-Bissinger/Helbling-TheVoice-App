<h1>The Voice. Insights into the Physiology of Singing and Speaking</h1>
<p>What actually happens inside the body when a person is speaking and singing?
This question is of great importance for anyone who makes conscious use of his or her voice, since the vocal processes inside the body normally cannot be seen. With the help of the most modern investigative techniques from high-tech medicine, a group of researchers at the <b>Freiburg Institute of Musicians&#x2019; Medicine (FIM)</b> has been exploring the bodily processes which are involved in the act of speaking and singing. In the course of these researches a comprehensive amount of film material has been gathered, which visually presents the movements of the respiratory system, the larynx and the vocal tract while a voice is being produced. "The Voice" contains 99 film clips with observations of processes taking place during various types of voice production. In addition, the films and animated sequences illustrate the most important organ systems involved in forming the voice and explain the basic physiological occurrences.</p>

<p class="caption_small">"The Voice" includes three chapters:</p>

<p>&#x201c;The Voice Organ&#x201d;</p>
<p>&#x201c;Types of Voice Production&#x201d;</p>
<p>&#x201c;Examination Methods&#x201d;</p>
</div>
</br>

<div class="content-box">
<p>In the chapter <b style="color: red;">1 The Voice Organ</b> the structure and function of the organ systems involved in the formation and development of sounds are explained and illustrated in easily understood terms, also using pictures and film sequences. In addition, the control of the complex interactions of these functional units is outlined.</p>

<div class="content-box">
<p>The chapter <b style="color: red;">2 Types of Voice Production </b> contains films made using dynamic magnetic resonance tomography, endoscopy, stroboscopy and high-speed glottography, which illustrate speaking styles (everyday talk as well as formal and stage speaking), and singing styles such as classical singing, folk song, belting, rock/pop and musical singing, rap, yodeling, beatboxing, and overtone singing. In addition, insights are provided into the processes of voice production during emotional statements or utterances, such as laughing, crying, and speaking while experiencing stage fright.</p>

<div class="content-box">
<p>The chapter <b style="color: red;">3 Examination Methods</b> demonstrates how voice production in the body&#x2019;s interior can be made visible. Also, measurement techniques are presented, which provide additional information about the quantitatively measureable parameters of voice production.</p>
<p>Using these parameters &#x2013; while taking into consideration the voice timbre and the singer&#x2019;s or speaker&#x2019;s self-perception of the voice &#x2013; the quality and effectiveness of a voice can be determined. Finally, easily utilized computer programs are introduced, with which a voice can be analyzed and &#x2013; as in a modular system &#x2013; be synthetically simulated as lifelike as possible.</p>
