<h1>Which new insights are provided in this medium?</h1>
<p>This medium is an innovative didactive aid designed to offer new insights into voice physiology. During its conception and development, the authors &#x2013; as professional musicians and singers, as well as specialists in musicians&#x2019; medicine &#x2013; set out to tackle in-depth questions related to vocal pedagogy and multi-media learning. They worked continuously in close contact with singers, speakers, vocal coaches and choir leaders, professors and students. </p>
<p>Visual learning, made possible using the films presented here, opens up a wide variety of new didactic approaches to the different contexts in which the voice can be used. A better knowledge of the inner workings of the body and its physiological processes leads to an enhanced understanding of individual vocal practices.</p>

<p class=cite>When I first saw the MRI images I was completely
amazed. I had had no idea about what was awaiting
me. This endless tongue, for example! I was already
familiar with the general physical attributes &#x2013; that was
a basic part of my vocal education. I won&#x2019;t adapt my
singing techniques to fit these video sequences. But
many of the subtleties and details related to the head
and throat regions were absolutely new to me.

<p class=cite>With the use of MRIs &#x2013; in combination with video
imaging of vocal folds and supralaryngeal actions &#x2013;,
singers and scientists can view, in real time, complex
interactions between laryngeal movement and vocal
tract changes which provide an important ancillary
method in singing analysis.

<p>This production serves as a supplement to the books, encyclopedias and technical works already published by the authors, which deal with the topics of voice, stage fright and vocal physiology. The specialized materials, which were previously explained with words and portrayed in pictures and tables, can now be observed more vividly and comprehensibly in active sequences, using films and animated illustrations.</p>

<p>At the same time it is quite important to keep generalizations in a proper perspective. These films are meant primarily to make visible single, individual examples of physiological processes. Thus, experienced professional artists specializing in the styles featured were asked to contribute to the film. In principle, however, no &#x201c;right&#x201d; or &#x201c;wrong&#x201d; speaking and singing techniques can be inferred or derived from these examples. Medicine as a specialist field is in a process of continuous development. Especially in the realm of voice physiology the on-going scientific discourse is of a very complex nature and cannot be adequately represented in this production. In order to ensure that this subject area is made comprehensible to the broadest circle of persons interested in matters related to the voice we have attempted to render complicated interrelationships as simply as possible. </p>
<p>Although basic overall principles can be discerned in the films, no deliberate doctrines or firmly established convictions should be inferred from the particular detailed sequences. </p>
<p>Those interested in reading more about scientific assessments of the films can consult the specialist publications of the FIM research group listed at <a href='https://www.fim.mh-freiburg.de' target='_blank'>www.fim.mh-freiburg.de</a>.</p>

<h1>How to use this medium</h1>
<p>These films have been conceptualized as a teaching aid. They can be used interactively, without any previous medical knowledge, in speech and singing lessons, in subject-specific teaching approaches, for voice training in choirs, and for music lessons at secondary schools. It is also well-suited for self-study. This production is meant to provide specialists in the fields of music physiology and musicians' medicine with new, original insights, and the films can also be included in courses on &#x201c;voice physiology&#x201d; at music universities.</p>
<p>For better understanding, the clips are accompanied with spoken commentaries (&#xd83d;&#xdde3;). If it is necessary to explain certain issues in class the films can also be watched without commentaries.</p>

<p>To derive the greatest benefits from the films we recommend that every viewer initially be offered the information provided in the chapter  <b>The Voice Organ</b>. This chapter introduces and explains the structures and functions of the organs involved in producing the voice, ensuring that the best advantage will be gained from watching the films dealing with the forms of vocal expression.</p>
<p>The same is true for the chapter <b>Examination Methods</b>. Here you learn how the films were produced, which enables you to better appreciate their qualities &#x2013; and gain an understanding of possible technical limitations, for example in tone quality.</p>
<p>In the chapter <b>Types of Voice Production</b> we recommend watching the films on various voice styles, which may not yet be quite familiar to the learner. Additional insights can be gained from observing various similarities and differences.</p>
